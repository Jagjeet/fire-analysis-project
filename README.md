# fire-analysis-project

This project's goal is to analyze [fire data](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires) and analyze it with respect to [air quality data](https://www.kaggle.com/epa/epa-historical-air-quality). We will be looking at the following areas:

* Comparing national fire data with California fire data
* Comparing national fire data with national air quality data
* Looking at the correlation of counties with worse air quality and fires
* Projecting fires (count, potential causes, counties most impacted, etc.) for the future

All data is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)

## Project Techical Requirements

The project will meet the following requirements:

* Use Pandas to clean and format your data set(s)
* Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process
* Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis
* Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per “question” you ask of your data)
* Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation
* Optionally, use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions
* Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each “question” you asked of your data, and under each heading, a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.

## Project Presentational Requirements

* Be at least 8-10 min. long
* Describe the core message or hypothesis for your project.
* Describe the questions you and your group found interesting, and what motivated you to answer them
* Summarize where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions
* Describe the data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
* Describe the analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
* Summarize your conclusions. This should include a numerical summary (i.e., what data did your analysis yield), as well as visualizations of that summary (plots of the final analysis data)
* Discuss the implications of your findings. This is where you get to have an open-ended discussion about what your findings “mean”.
* Tell a good story! Storytelling through data analysis is no different than in literature. Find your narrative and use your analysis and visualization skills to highlight conflict and resolution in your data.

## Prerequisites

To run this project the following tools are needed:

* Python (tested with v3.85, earlier versions may work as well, but have not been tested)
* Jupyter Notebooks and/or Jupyter Labs

## Usage

Clone the respository and open and run the `TBD.ipynb` from Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Labs.

Analysis can be viewed in the individual cells.

## Known Issues

* In some cases data from previous Jupyter cells are used to calculate values in the current cell. As such make sure to run all above cells to obtain the correct output
